PHP Personal Budget
-------------------------------------------------
PHP Personal Budget has been developed using PHP 5 and MySQL 5. It has not
yet been tested in PHP 4 but since we are using Code Igniter as the underlying
framework it should work for PHP 4. If it does not, please submit a bug 
letting us know where you run into problems and we will look into the issue.
